Reproducable DevEnv designed for Fun and Peak Performance

1. **Reproducable** - recreate your environment within minutes not hours 
3. **Immutable** in at least thinking -  perminate changes to VM encouraged be defined in vagrant file only
4. **Minimalistic** - *distractionless and minimal bandwidth and space to reproduce* - currently only tools for peak performance i.e. prefered editors & browswers.
4. **Extendable with** tools like Docker on the fly
5. **Promotes Community** - lets help each other create the best peakDev there is.
    * Helpful example docker files and scripts to show common extra toolsets
    * Well documented process to set up and use
    * Dynamic/evolving from what is learnt.
